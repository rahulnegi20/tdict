# Terminal Google Dictionary (online)

### Too Geeky(Lazy) to go (google/bing) meaning of the word?
Well, then this is the perfect script for you!

## Example :
![t-dict](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36270407/128837743-5c76d4fd-a3eb-4cc4-95ab-6f7dab7c2415.png)

## How to use?
There are two seperate branches for [Linux](https://github.com/rahulnegi20/tdict/) and [Windows](https://github.com/rahulnegi20/tdict/tree/windows)

## For Windows : 
Installing for Windows is described [here](https://github.com/rahulnegi20/tdict/tree/windows).


## For Linux : 
Download or clone this repository (https://github.com/rahulnegi20/tdict.git)
and then check requirements.txt, I have mentioned the procedure with steps.

Just type the word and get the meaning of the word in your terminal.
You can search for synonyms and examples too!


### Basic Requirements :

*  python3
*  urllib
*  yachalks

#### In order to run the script from terminal (anylocation)


>you need to provide path to tdict in your .bashrc file which is hidden by default, (Ctrl + H) to unhide the hidden files or vice-versa. now you need to edit that .bashrc file using any text editor and add this line on top

`PATH="$PATH:<path-to-dict-folder>"`
for example , in my case it is <br>
(/home/rahulnegi/projects/scripts/dict).


## Development :

This script uses unofficial Google-Dictionary api (https://github.com/meetDeveloper/googleDictionaryAPI)
